# WebsiteChatBot
A tester of the website chatbot. Includes a homescreen, pop up chatbot and a responses page where main interaction happens.

What you are looking at here is the website chatbot tester. 
There are no libraries needed for this, it should be a "plug and play" bit of code. 
When running, you should be taken to opening up a web tab, clicking on the bottom right, a small animation so the chatbot pops up, and then can interact. 
Buttons are pretty useless and gimmicky, but the chatbot should tell you what you can and can't do :)
